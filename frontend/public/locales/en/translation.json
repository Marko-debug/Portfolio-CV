  "About Me Text": "I am a person who strives to advance in my career, whether by learning foreign languages, programming languages or sports activities like basketball etc. Hardworking and committed, I deliver projects to the highest professional standard. At the moment I'm trying to be versatile in the tech world, that means whatever language you give me that's what I'm going to learn because I've already done frontend, backend, deployment, testing, support, communicating to customers or presenting in front of customers. So I'm trying to improve not only in technology skills but also in communication skills."
